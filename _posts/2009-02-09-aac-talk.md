I just got back from [acts_as_conference](http://actsasconference.com) and it was great! I promised a few people that I'd put up my slides so here they are:

<div style="width:425px;text-align:left" id="__ss_1009857"><object style="margin:0px" width="425" height="355"><param name="movie" value="http://static.slideshare.net/swf/ssplayer2.swf?doc=relaxing-with-couchdb-acts-as-conference-final-1234224419527061-2&rel=0&stripped_title=relaxing-with-couchdb" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"/><param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always"/><embed src="http://static.slideshare.net/swf/ssplayer2.swf?doc=relaxing-with-couchdb-acts-as-conference-final-1234224419527061-2&rel=0&stripped_title=relaxing-with-couchdb" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="355"></embed></object></div>

Thanks again to everyone who made this a fantastic conference.
