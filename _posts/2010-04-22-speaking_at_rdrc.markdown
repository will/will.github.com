I'll be speaking about using CouchDB from ruby at the upcoming [Red Dirt Ruby Conference][rdrc] on May 6th in Oklahoma City. The format is new, at least to me. There are four themes: Ruby, Rails 3, NoSQL, and Servers.

[My talk][mytalk] is in the NOSQL theme and it will give you everything you need to get started using CouchDB from Ruby. The rest of the lineup looks amazing, and I'm really looking forward to it.

I'll be sure to post slides and such up here when I have them. Hope to see you in Oklahoma!

Update: And here are my slides:
