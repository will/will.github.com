I gave a few talks and just realized I never put them up anywhere.
The first talk is one I gave as an introduction to BDD using rspec to some students at uiuc.
It seems like giving an "intro to bdd" talk is something everyone has to eventually do ;)

Second is a talk I gave at pecha kucha, which is a lot like ignite. Same auto advancing format, just a different amount of slides and time per slide.
