I made the transition to <a href="http://webby.rubyforge.org/">webby</a> for the blog. Last time I made I tried to upgrade typo, the migrations broke, everything blew up, tears and sorrow. For a one author blog, there isn't really any need for a web ui to write posts, or any of the features you get from a blogging engine. Plus you can throw the whole thing in git.

Other people have written quality articles on webby. Rather than repeating everything, I'll just link them here

* "Mike Clark - Building Static Websites with Webby":http://clarkware.com/cgi/blosxom/2008/08/06
* "Mangus Holm - Building a Website with Webby":http://judofyr.net/posts/building-a-website-with-webby.html
* "github search: 'webby'":https://github.com/search?q=webby - some people have shared their source for their blogs. Reading code is always a great place to start.
