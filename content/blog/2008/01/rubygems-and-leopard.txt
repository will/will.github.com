I just got my replacement iMac (the speakers were shot on the first one) and was going about getting my development environment back together. While trying to instal <a href="http://datamapper.org/">datamapper</a>, it choked on the json gem.
<pre class="source-code"><code>ruby extconf.rb install json<br />can't find header files for ruby.</code></pre>
As it turns out, the solution is very simple. I didn't have Xcode tools from the install disc on there yet. Since it's something you just put on once then forget about, it took me a while to realize what was going on. Hopefully this post helps others figure it out quicker than I did if they stumble across it.

Also remember to update RubyGems. Leopard comes with 0.9.4 and we're up to 1.0.1 right now.
<pre class="source-code"><code> sudo gem update --system</code></pre>
