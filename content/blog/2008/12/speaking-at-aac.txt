I attended Acts as Confernece last February and had a wonderful time. This time around I'm giving a talk There's really something great about small conferences.


Acts as Conference 2009 is a two-day Rails conference that will make you a more competitive Rails developer by learning from those driving the innovation that is fueling the Rails community. Held February 6th and 7th in Orlando, Florida, Acts as Conference features a great speaker lineup, free food, a chance to meet with Rails innovators, and a live via video Q&A session with David Heinemeier Hansson. At $125 dollars and limited to 175 attendees, the conference will sell out fast, perhaps faster than last year. Register today at http://www.actsasconference.com. See you there!
