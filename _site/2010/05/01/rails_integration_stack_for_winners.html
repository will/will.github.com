<p>Full-stack, acceptance, integration, or whatever-you-want-to-call-it testing should be a large part of your test suite. I'm not going to waste time trying to convince anyone of this, since there are probably a million other blog posts doing that (and probably twice as many arguing the different names).</p>

<p><img src="/images/finish.jpg" alt="finish line" />
Rather, I'll show you the hands-down best way to do it with what's out there right now. Follow this setup and you too can be a winner. I've written <a href="/2009/06/celerity.html">a bit</a> about this earlier, but things have gotten better since then.</p>

<p>Currently, while Rails 3 is close, it's not out yet, so I'm ignoring it for this post. Latest is 2.3.5. Here we go.</p>

<h2>Cucumber</h2>

<p>Cucumber drives everything. It's awesome, and you should have already heard of it. Everyone uses it. It's surpassed the vegetable on google for the top result.</p>

<p>It ships with webrat, but <em>don't use webrat</em>. It's neat and probably helped a lot to get cucumber popular. But it can't do javascript. And what site doesn't have JS these days. You need to be testing that too, you know.</p>

<p><a href="http://cukes.info/">Cucumber &mdash; cukes.info</a></p>

<h2>Capybara</h2>

<p>This is what you use instead of webrat. It lets you use a bunch of web drivers behind it. Out out of the box it supports selenium (ugh) and Celerity/Culerity (awesome). Before getting cucumber to work with Capybara was a little hacky, but they're best friends now. Use this.</p>

<p>You tag the stories that need javascript with @javascript, and it'll fire up culerity when it needs to. That's all you have to do. It's fantastic.</p>

<p><a href="http://github.com/jnicklas/capybara">Capybara &mdash; github</a></p>

<h2>Culerity</h2>

<p>This provides a nice bridge between your MRI Ruby rails app, and the jruby-only gem Celerity. It'll fire off a separate server running in the test environment, then start up a jruby process for celerity.</p>

<p>Now this one can be a bit of a pain to set up, since you need to install jruby and then celerity and make sure that's all working and wired up. A nice alternative is <a href="http://github.com/fletcherm/culerity/">Matt Fletcher's fork</a>, which bundles all that into the gem itself so you don't have to worry about it.</p>

<p>There can be some problems with gem bundler, though. The gist of it is that you have to use JRuby v1.3.1 or earlier. I wrote more details about the bug on the  <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/culerity-dev/browse_thread/thread/3c1ed5f38d540ad1">mailing list</a>. It looks like <em>just yesterday</em> Matt updated his fork to fix this, so hurray!</p>

<p><a href="http://github.com/langalex/culerity">Culerity &mdash; github</a></p>

<h2>Celerity</h2>

<p>This is what's actually doing the work. It's a JRuby-only gem, since it uses the Java <a href="http://httpunit.sourceforge.net/">HttpUnit</a> headless web browser. This is a complete web browser, with its own javascript engine, except it is just controlled though some API, and doesn't have a display.</p>

<p>Selenium was cool for it's time. Watir too, I guess, though I never used it. But relying on a real browser sucks. It's really slow. You have to worry about browser upgrades breaking the tenuous control. And it makes your CI server a hundred times more complicated than it has to be. Fuck that, when you can use Celerity which is awesome.</p>

<p>For some reason I can't quite remember, I had to stay on version 0.7.6. If you're having weird problems try that version. Of course, if you're using Matt's culerity fork like I suggested, you don't have to worry about it.</p>
